# solana-riddleapp

In the process of creating a very simple riddle dApp with a smart contract on Solana. The idea is that there will be an initial riddle and answer to said riddle stored in an account owned by the program.
Users will be able to guess the answer to the riddle from a client interface. If they guess the correct answer, they will be able to replace the current riddle/answer with one of their own choosing.
Right now, anyone can replace the riddle/answer at any time regardless if they have correctly guess the initial riddle, want to imporve upon the accesibility of that function in the future.

This was created from the same base code of the messengerapp I made earlier in this repo https://github.com/ixmorrow/solana-messengerapp
